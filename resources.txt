What is a repository and what is its relationship with files?
  A repository holds all the files, folders, and related content of a website. 
How are VCS useful?
  VCS allow the developer to make file changes and gives them the ability to track those changes. They also allow developers the ability to revert changes.
  Another reason VCS are uuseful is it is easy to incoporate repositories on a site like GitHub, which is a standard industry tool, and then have access to 
  cloud backup and a free hosted webspace.
Do you have a favoite artistic medium? Why is this your favorite?
  My favorite artistic medium is watercolor painting. I love working with the paints and experimenting with the motion of water on a paper to create different
  designs and patterns.
